What resources are there to learn about systems programming?

First of all, you should just program! But there are some resources:

## Hash tables

Youtube talks by Google guys:

Blog post by facebook guys:

There are also a bunch of podcasts.

## Compression

Compression is a great topic when it comes to performance programming. Because
if you can come up with a more efficient compression algorithm, you can use it
everywhere. In the storage industry, this is particularly important. If you
have better compression, you can sell less capacity for the same price.

## Games

Game programming is a common domain for performance. Because gamers
always want the best graphics.

## Interview Preparation

- [Guide on interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/guides/system-design-interview)
    They're a website offering mock interviews, but they have a really cool write up to help you prepare for free. (I'd pay for that write-up if it was a book to be honest)

## Memory Allocators

- [Some slides](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2015/blob/master/Presentations/allocator%20Is%20to%20Allocation%20what%20vector%20Is%20to%20Vexation/allocator%20Is%20to%20Allocation%20what%20vector%20Is%20to%20Vexation%20-%20Andrei%20Alexandrescu%20-%20CppCon%202015.pdf) by Andrei Alexandrescu, there is a corresponding cppcon talk about it on Youtube 

## Other books that are super cool
