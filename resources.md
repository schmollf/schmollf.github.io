## Compression

Compression is a great topic when it comes to performance programming. Because
if you can come up with a more efficient compression algorithm, you can use it
everywhere. In the storage industry, this is particularly important. If you
have better compression, you can sell less capacity for the same price.

## Games

Game programming is a common domain for performance. Because gamers
always want the best graphics.
